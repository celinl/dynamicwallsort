MoMath Hackathon 2018: Sorting Methods
Dynamic Wall Behaviour
Celine Lee

The Math:
I have used the dynamic wall slates to simulate various sorting methods such as bubble sort, quick sort, selection sort, insertion sort and merge sort. These sorting methods take the randomly arranged set of slates and arranges them in order of depth.

The Submission:
The point of this project is to provide a visual representation of the different sorting methods to children, making it more aesthetically engaging and allowing them to grasp the general idea of each sorting method.
